# ðŸ”— Website-Tracker_Extension_0726

Website Tracker is a simple yet effective Chrome extension that helps you keep track of URLs for your research, reading, or prospecting. Save websites either manually or with a single click using the "Save Tab" button. Your saved links are stored locally and persist even when you close the browser.
